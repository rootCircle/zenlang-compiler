# Zen Programming Language Compiler

Welcome to the Zen programming language compiler repository! Zen is a user-friendly programming language designed for simplicity and joy in coding. This compiler, written in Rust, allows you to translate Zen code into executable programs.

## Installation

To install the Zen compiler, use the following `cargo` command:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/zenlang-rs/compiler.git
```

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If not, you can install them by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

For Windows users, a faster and lighter setup is available using the Windows Package Manager (`winget`). Run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
winget install rustup
rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the Zen compiler to run Zen programs:

```bash
zen your_program.zen
```

For more detailed information on the Zen language syntax and features, refer to the [ZenDocs](https://zenlang.netlify.app/docs).
